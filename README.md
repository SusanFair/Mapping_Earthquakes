# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Project
This project was a exercise in GeoJSON mapping using live data to drive a real world geographical map.  The data supplied provided information on recent earthquakes over several weeks and major earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 and higher over the last week.  

## Results
The result isa multi-layered map with plenty of detail.  Since tectonic plates are known to be high impact areas for earthquakes, these were added to the map for reference.  Three map layers Street view, Satellite view, and a dark or night view are available through the layers icon on the top right of the screen.  Earthquake types and the tectonic plates can be removed or added via the same layer icon using the check boxes.

Using magnitude data to drive the radius and color of the earthquake events you can cleary see the difference between the various magnitudes of the earthquakes.  Also the pop up information will identiy if the earth quake came from the overall earthquake data or the Major Earthquake data for the last week.  These will be shown as "Magnitude-Major" and have a slightly deeper color scheme.

## Summary
The Geo mapping of earthquake data clearly shows the association between tectonic plates and the prevelance of earthquake events.  It also shows in an efficient manner the scale of the earthquakes in the various areas around the globe.
