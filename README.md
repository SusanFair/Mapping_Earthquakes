# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Project
This project was a exercise in GeoJSON mapping using live data to drive real world geographical maps.  The data supplied provided information on recent earthquakes and major earthquakes magnitude 4.5 and higher over the last week.  

## Results
The results are a multi-layered map.  Since tectonic plates are known to be high impact areas for earthquakes these were added to the map for reference.  Three map layers Street view, Satellite view, and a dark or night view are available through the layers icon on the top right of the screen.  Earthquake types and the tectonic plates can be removed or added via the same layer icon using the check boxes.

Using madnitude data to drive the radius and color you can cleary see the difference between the magnitudes of the earthquakes.  Also the pop up information will identiy if the earth quake came from the overall earthquake data or the Major Earthquake data for the last week.  These will be shown as "Magnitude-Major" and have a slightly deeper color scheme.

## Summary
The Geo mapping of earthquake data clearly shows the association between tectonic plates and prevelance of earthquake events.  It also shows in an efficient manner the scale of the earthquakes in the various areas around the globe.
